# E-commerce ML Capstone Project  

This repository contains my capstone project completed as part of the **AI & ML program**.  
The project demonstrates the **end-to-end Data Science lifecycle** — from data collection to model building — applied to an **E-commerce dataset**.

## 📂 Project Structure  
- **1. Data Collection.ipynb** → Collecting and preparing raw data  
- **2. Data Preprocessing.ipynb** → Cleaning and preprocessing  
- **3. Univariate and Bivariate Analysis.ipynb** → Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- **4. Model Creation.ipynb** → Training and evaluating machine learning models  
- **ecommerce_Best_Model.sav** → Finalized and serialized best model

## 🚀 Features
- Complete end-to-end machine learning workflow  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualisations  
- Model training, evaluation, and saving the best model  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📊 Results
